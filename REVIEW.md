# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Only have code that is used in the codebase
2. Component files should be named after the component, not index
3. I'm not a fan of ...restProps, they encourage giving the wrong arguments
